# euROBIN_WP1_collection

This is a repository to collect the contributions from the euROBIN WP1 Partners as part of the [euROBIN Project](https://eurobin-project.eu/). This is only an intial collection and we can organize the contents after we have received them. 

As a goal, submissions to this repository can be downloaded and run by the partners to test on their physical robot platform and evaluated on their task board.

## Ongoing Projects
