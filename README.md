# euROBIN_WP1_collection

This is a repository to collect the contributions from the euROBIN WP1 Partners as part of the [euROBIN Project](https://eurobin-project.eu/). This is only an intial collection and we can organize the contents after we have received them. 

As a goal, submissions to this repository can be downloaded and run by the partners to test on their physical robot platform and evaluated on their task board.

## Ongoing Projects
- euROBIN Partner Solutions to the Task Board (This repo)
- [euROBIN Task Board Web Dashbaord](https://cloud.kaaiot.com/wd-public/c1v9jqmgul2l1s47m6bg/dashboards/48362071-9535-4458-9655-e75311aa9e04/931cb10a-3044-49c8-8530-5ce0951e291b?public_id=4e4990d1-dcab-4f1a-b1a6-8648e87bc5ad) to view telemetry data from task board network
- Manipulation Skill Electronic Task Board (Contact: Peter So, TUM) : Project Repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/peterso/robotlearningblock)
- Simulation Environment for Task Board (Contact: Giang Nguyen, UBREMEN): Project Repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Multiverse-Framework/Multiverse-Docker)


## Published Research 
Below is a list of published research supported by the euROBIN project WP1 partners.
